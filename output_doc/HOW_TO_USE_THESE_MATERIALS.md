## 📧 Pitch Templates (If Submitting to Publications)

### To n8n Blog:
```
Subject: Guest Post Idea: Building a Production GTM Console with n8n

Hi [Editor Name],

I built a desktop GTM operations console using n8n as the backend, and it reduced our prospect time by 83% while cutting API costs by 60%.

The architecture uses Electron (frontend) + n8n (backend) + Airtable (database), with 5 core workflows handling draft generation, email sending, and follow-up automation.

I think the n8n community would find it interesting to see how n8n can power production applications beyond simple automations.

Would this be a good fit for your blog? I have a 5,000-word draft ready, with screenshots and workflow diagrams.

Full draft: [link]

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### To Airtable Blog:
```
Subject: Case Study: Using Airtable as the Database for a Desktop App

Hi [Editor Name],

I used Airtable as the database for a desktop GTM console that automates cold outreach and follow-ups.

Key insight: Airtable's zero-schema setup and built-in UI made it perfect for a decoupled architecture where non-technical users need to access data directly.

The result: 83% time savings per prospect and a flexible system that's easy to modify without migrations.

I think this showcases a unique use case for Airtable beyond traditional spreadsheet alternatives.

Would this be interesting for your blog?

Draft: [link]

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```
